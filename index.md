## Projects

I'm currently working on one project, [com.jason.kslo](https://github.com/johnfai91). It's an Android app for my school's student to browse the school website and homework. 

The aim of it is to provide a place to check their homework and provide a better experience and encourage students to browse the **10 years** old UI design of the intranet. As a by-product, I also implemented the school website and the library for the convenince of the users.

## More about me
I'm now learning Android App development in Java and it's quite fun.
