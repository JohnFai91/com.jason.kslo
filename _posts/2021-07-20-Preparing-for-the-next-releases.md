## I'm back again
Hi there! After all those exams, I've finally got time to continue on developing this app. It isn't as stressful as before as I cannot think of any other major things to implement yet.

## Summary
The releases have benn slowed down as mentioned mainly because the app is more stable and I can focus on other things. You may have discovered that the releases are further away from each other by now, and the releases have just minor improvements since beta version 1.1.0-beta which underwent a UI change. Before the stable state, my goal was to push a release every other week with major changes and improvements, but since I removed webview and replaced them with my own UI, the things left for me to do is just to crush bugs.

## Future
The plan now is to release one version per month and make some minor improvements like UI elements, user experience and so on. Maybe I will implement some advanced features such as notifications but I'll still need some research. Moreover, the dashboard may get deleted as we are in different classes or study different subjects, that'll leave more room for the gallery and borrowed books as they are now squeezed together.
